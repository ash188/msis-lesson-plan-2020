## Data stores to discuss

We discussed these common hierarchical data structures in class or in readings

## Adding a sortable script
We’ll flesh out the table on our Dashboard, then I’ll ask them to add a script to sort their tables in their dashboard app.

Probably this one, because it’s easy: http://tristen.ca/tablesort/demo/ , although I also like this one: https://github.hubspot.com/sortable/docs/welcome/
